## Plant Disease Detection System
**Overview**

Our solution utilizes a Python Convolutional Neural Network model for accurate plant
disease diagnosis By training the model on a diverse dataset of plant images, it learns to
recognize disease patterns Users can upload plant images, which are preprocessed and passed
through the trained CNN model for inference The model analyzes the image's features and
predicts the presence of diseases with confidence scores A user friendly interface enhances
usability, providing real time predictions and information on identified diseases Regular model
updates with new labeled data ensure its effectiveness This solution empowers stakeholders in
implementing timely disease management practices, promoting sustainable agriculture and
crop health

**SDGs that are being met:**

A plant disease detection system can contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depending on its design, implementation, and application. Here are a few SDGs that can be positively impacted by a plant disease detection system:

**SDG 2:** Zero Hunger: By accurately identifying and detecting plant diseases, the system can help farmers prevent or manage outbreaks, minimizing crop losses and ensuring food security.

**SDG 3:** Good Health and Well-being: Early detection of plant diseases allows for timely interventions, reducing the need for excessive pesticide use. This can lead to safer agricultural practices, protecting the health of farmers and consumers.

**SDG 12:** Responsible Consumption and Production: Plant disease detection systems can support sustainable agriculture by enabling targeted and precise use of pesticides, minimizing their environmental impact, and reducing waste.

**SDG 13:** Climate Action: By preventing crop losses and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, plant disease detection systems can contribute to climate change mitigation efforts and the resilience of agricultural systems.

**SDG 15:** Life on Land: Early detection of plant diseases can help protect biodiversity by preventing the spread of invasive species and controlling the impact of plant diseases on ecosystems.

**SDG 17:** Partnerships for the Goals: Collaboration between researchers, farmers, and relevant stakeholders in developing and implementing plant disease detection systems can enhance knowledge sharing, capacity building, and technology transfer.

It's important to note that the specific impact of a plant disease detection system on the SDGs may vary depending on factors such as the scope of the system, its accessibility to different stakeholders, and the effectiveness of follow-up actions taken based on the detection results.
